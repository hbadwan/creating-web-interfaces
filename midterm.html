<h1> Hannah Badwan Mid-term</h1>
<p>
I took this class because I was interested in being able to build my own web-site and perchance get an internship over the summer relating to front-end web development. I saw a post on etsy that they were looking for front-end web developers and how they believe in "code as craft" -- the web is not going anywhere anytime soon -- if you can't beat 'em, join 'em!
